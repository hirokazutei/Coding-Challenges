# Coding-Challenges
To continously improve my coding skills, I am doing coding challenges to hone my algorithm claws!

## Background
In preparation for my Google interview, I have begun doing coding challenges to improve my skills and exercise my brain.
Since then, I have gotten myself addicted to coding problems and I have decided to attempt to do one (or few) everyday!

I have dedicated this repository to organize the questions I have done on Cracking the Coding Interview book, Project Euler or any other coding problems I find online. In addition, I am hoping to write few basic data structures, soring algorithms, searching algorithms, etc. so that it could perhaps be of use for others to have access to how they are written.

This project will not only help me improve my coding and problem solving skill, but I am striving to improve my communication skills by adding comments on my thought processes behind solving these problems and if available, how others have solved it better!
