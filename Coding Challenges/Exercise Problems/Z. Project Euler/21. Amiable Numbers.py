# 21. Amiable Numbers

"""
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

# Brainstorm
"""
Brute Force:
Find the factors of each number from 1 to 1000, add the numbers together and see if the factors of the sum adds up to the
original number.

Sieve:
Repeating the process of finding the factors for all numbers is computationally expensive. We can reduce this by
pre-computing the factors for each number. Then retrieve the sum of their factors and see if it matches with the
factors of their potentially amiable pair.
