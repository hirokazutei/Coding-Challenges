# Linked List
### What is it?
  Linked list is a series of nodes where each node stores data as well as a pointer to the next node. When you search through a linked list, you iterate through each node, resulting in O(N). The usefulness of linked list comes from the fact that deleting a node, inserting a node or switching nodes around does not take additional memory for you are simply reassigning pointers.
#### Singly Linked List
  A Singly Linked List begins with a starting node that contains both the data and also a pointer that points to the next node.
#### Doubly Linked List
  A Doubly Linked List is mostly the same as a singly linked list except each node also points to the node previous of itself.
