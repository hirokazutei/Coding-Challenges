# Coding-Challenges
In Preparation for Interviews, I am coding common data structures and algorithms as an exercise and for fun!

## Background

## Format
##### A. I will first write the code to a data structure or an algorithm with Python without looking at example codes.
##### B. I will later evaluate my code and find potential problems and improvements as I get better at coding.
##### C. I will later compare my code to a conventionally written one and study how I could have written it better or had I made any mistakes.
